# Prusa-MINI-bear-mod-Z10
Bear mod for Prusa MINI(+)


## -----Work in Progress------ ##

I have not printed the parts yet. An update will follow soon with the realized mod.


First, a big thank you to the developers of the Prusa (Mini) Bear and subsequent remixes that I used for this mod, namely pear3d.ch, Tomson and Gregsaun, and of course Prusa Research.

*Disclaimer: My Original Prusa Mini+ is in fact an amazing little printer and as far as I am concerned the print quality is incredible for the price and ease of use. I was tempted to proceed with this build for the main reason that I enjoy tinkering with 3D printers towards the possibility of improvement. In this case, towards a possibly more robust frame, which would (in theory at least) allow to maintain the same quality at higher accelerations with a direct-drive extruder to ease printing of flexible filaments. Keep in mind, as with any DYI assembly, there is always a chance of the final produced print quality to suffer, as it depends on the sourced hardware quality, part design and on the actual skills and experience put into building.*

Background:

There are quite a few models and tutorials in Printables to build your Prusa Mini Bear mod, but as soon as you try to dive into versions and part compatibility, it becomes chaotic. Before printing, I wanted to ensure that all parts are well aligned and compatible with each other, but I quickly realized, as far as I could find, there was no published CAD version with a complete model, so I had either to make a collection and hope for the best, or work on my own remix.

Most importantly I observed the following issues:

No stock Prusa extruder R6 version with proper probe offsets.
X and Y belts not running parallel to the axis.
No CAD to verify of a version with 10mm Z axis rod.
Z rods where not properly aligned with X axis holders and top Z brackets.

I did the necessary modifications to the Fusion 360 designs I could find (see base remixes), as to fix the above issues.

For the extruder, I started from the stock part as released by Prusa Research: https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3

Parts that are not modified:

Buddy board case: [Link](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-MINI/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION/ELECTRONICS/mini-motor-kit.pdf)
Y-rod-holders, Y-idler-tension, 2040 end caps: [Link](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade)

Pictures color coding (printed parts): 

Blue/orange: Non-stock (Bear and Mini-Bear) parts. 
Black: Can be used from the stock Prusa Mini.
Ready-to-print STL files will follow as soon as I print the parts and complete the transition. Moreover, if there is enough interest I will accommodate a guide for this version.

Cheers!
